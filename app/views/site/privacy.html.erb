<h4>
  Contributions
</h4>
<p>
  When you make edits to the rə maps data on this website you agree that you are lawfully entitled and have full authority to license this website
  to use the information you upload and to make it publicly available.   Once you upload an edit it becomes a permanent part of the rə maps database -- it cannot be
  deleted.  You (or any user) can upload additional edits to delete or makes changes to data you previously uploaded, but both the original edit
  and any subsequent edits will be a permanent part of the database.
  If you delete your account, your contributions will be de-identified (that is, they’re no longer associated with your account) but they will not be deleted.
</p>
<h5>Will I get paid for my contributions?</h5>
<p>No. rə maps is a community effort–we rely on the goodwill of community members to help us revive the past and together build a mapping service with a time dimension, such that everybody in the world can benefit.</p>
<h5>How do you use my contributions?</h5>
<p>The contributions that you make are stored on our servers and are open sourced such that they are publicly accessible. We may use this information to generate other data (e.g. 3D models of buildings
  based on building outlines in the maps database) or serve them directly.  We may validate your contributions by automatic or manual processes. Contributions may be used to train computer algorithms.  Note that since your contributions are open sourced, we have no control on how they will be used by others.</p>
<h4>Logins</h4>
<p>
  Logins and sign ups via Google only have emails stored. This is to aid in the system identifying you correctly. The
  email address for your account will never be published anywhere or shared with third party organisations. Only administrators have direct access to email address data.
</p>
<h4>Account Removal</h4>
<p>
  You can delete your account at any time, by clicking on the "Settings" link.
  If you delete your account, your contributions will be de-identified (that is, they’re no longer associated with your account) but they will not be deleted.</p>
